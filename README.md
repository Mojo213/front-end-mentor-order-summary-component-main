The challenge presented by frontend mentor was to create an order summary card using HTML and CSS.  The images, font family, font size and example design were provided for me in order to recreate the summary card. Although nt perfect i am proud of my attempt and thoroughly  enjoyed the process, overall it was a good learning experience.
